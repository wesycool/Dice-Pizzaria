# ***nutShell*** Dashboard Web Application

### User Story:
As an everyday mobile user, I want a single platform to access information immediately relevant to my day so that I can avoid using multiple applications.
### Objectives:
*nutShell* is a mobile first web application that aims to consolidate the digital organizational tools we employ on a daily basis into one space. Users will be able to customize the platform to best satisfy their preferences, eliminating the need for multiple, independent applications. 

As everyday mobile users ourselves, we aimed to develop a dashboard application that would help resolve the common issue of overcrowding; the need for multiple applications and the flood of irrelevant information weâ€™re often bombarded with. In doing so, we hope to streamline these processes and make the task of organizing daily life more user friendly.

### Requirements:
**For this web application, we were required to:**
* Use at least two side-server APIs.
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Develop a web application that was interactive.
* Use at least one third-party API.
* Include a polished and professional user interface.
* Meet good quality coding standards that prioritized organization and readability.
* Avoid using alerts, confirms, and prompts.
* Explore the use of modals.
* Deploy our application on Github Pages.

**For our presentation, we were required to include:**   
* ***Elevator Pitch***: a one minute description of our application.
* ***Concept***: the inclusion of our user story and our motivation for development.
* ***Process***: an explanation of the technologies used, the method of delegation and task assignment, challenges faced, as well as successes.
* ***Demo***: a pre-recorded video demonstration in which our application is run through and explained.
* ***Future Development***: an outline of the future direction of our web application and ways to expand.
* ***Links***: provide access to the Github repository in which the information is stored, as well as access to the deployed application itself. 
### Process:
As a group, we viewed our project as an opportunity to solidify our understanding of topics with which we had previously encountered difficulties. Because of this, elements of our project were assigned according to who would benefit the most from working through the steps required to complete said element. 

#### **Task Delegation:** ####
* ***Shayanne*** was responsible for the rendering of the login page that allows users to create an account, generate a password, login, and maintain selected settings through the use of local storage. Likewise, he graciously volunteered to execute the oral presentation given in class, as well as record and narrate our demonstrative video
* ***Edmund's*** role in our group has been instrumental in the consolidation of our files, and the success of our deployed application. In addition to providing educational support to the remaining three group members, he was responsible for successfully constructing the sidebar, settings menu, as well as the stocks display that can be found on the homepage. 
* ***Christine*** was assigned the task of constructing the navbar which included a weather and time display, as well as a modal which contained the local 5-day forecast using the openweathermap.org APIs. In collaboration with her group members, she was also responsible for constructing the README.md file and the powerpoint presentation that would be used in tendem with Shayanne's oral presentation.
* ***Chet*** applied his skills in rendering a functional calendar application as well as a day planner application that effectively displays and saves tasks relative to the dates selected within the calendar. Users are able to input and store tasks using local storage, making each of these tasks readily available each time a user becomes logged in.

### Future Development:
In regards to the future, *nutShell* has the potential to grow in many different directions and there are multiple avenues that we would be intersted in pursuing in the future. Some of these developments include:
* Optimizing customization of the homepage and sidebar by allowing users to choose from a selection of options they wish to display, thereby profiding the most efficient experience possible. 
* Implementing a transportation API option (TTC, NextBus).
* Offering the option to receive sports updates.
* Constructing a Kanban board organizational feature.
* Allowing users to add recipes to their daily planner. 
* Providing access to sales flyers.
* Extending the current daily scheduler to include 24 hours.
* Extending the current calendar application to include all 12 months.
